Key features of the system include:
User Registration and Login: Users can create an account and log in to the system using their credentials.
Admin Panel: The admin panel allows authorized personnel to manage the library resources, user accounts, and other administrative tasks.
Book Management: The system provides features to add, update, and delete books from the library inventory. It includes details such as title, author, publication date, and availability status.
Borrowing and Returning Books: Users can borrow books from the library by checking the availability and return them within the specified due dates. The system keeps track of borrowed books and manages late returns.
User Management: The admin has the authority to manage user accounts, including adding new users, editing user information, and disabling or deleting user accounts if necessary.
The system ensures data integrity by storing all information in a MySQL database, which provides reliable data storage and retrieval capabilities.
The implementation of the project follows secure coding practices, including measures to prevent unauthorized access and protect user data.
The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, providing an easy-to-navigate system for both admins and library users.
The project serves as an efficient solution for libraries, enabling them to streamline their operations, automate processes, and enhance user experience.
Future enhancements and possible extensions for the system may include features like reservation of books, fine calculation, integration with external library systems, and generating reports/statistics for analysis.
